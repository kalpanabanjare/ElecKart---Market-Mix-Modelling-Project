## Overview

This repository contains the analysis and modeling efforts for the ElecKart e-commerce case study. ElecKart, a leading e-commerce platform specializing in electronic products, faced significant challenges including a decline in revenue and high customer churn rates. This project aims to identify root causes and propose actionable solutions.

## Project Components

### Part I: Root Cause Analysis

- **Objective**: Conduct a root cause analysis of ElecKart's revenue issues using the 5 Whys technique.
- **Methodology**: Created an issue tree chart to identify underlying problems affecting revenue generation.

### Part II: SPIN Table Analysis

- **Objective**: Validate the findings with the Head of Marketing through a SPIN table.
- **Components**: Identified key situations, problems, implications, and need-payoffs based on discussions with the marketing team.

### Part III: Market Mix Modeling

- **Objective**: Develop market mix models for three product subcategories: Camera Accessory, Home Audio, and Gaming Accessory.
- **Data Sources**: Used order-level data, advertising spend data, NPS scores, stock indices, and climatic information from Ontario.
- **Pipeline Steps**:
  1. Data Preparation
  2. Feature Engineering
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  4. Model Building and Evaluation
  5. Presentation of Results

## Data

The data used for this project spans from July 2015 to June 2016 and includes:
- Order level data (including SKU, order ID, GMV, etc.)
- Monthly advertising spends
- NPS scores
- Climatic data for Ontario

The dataset is stored in a shared Google Drive folder. Please ensure you have access to this data to run the analyses.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

## Results

The project culminates in a PowerPoint presentation and a video summarizing the findings, model performance, and financial implications for ElecKart. These are stored in the `presentation` folder.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into ElecKartâ€™s operational inefficiencies and proposes a structured approach to optimize marketing spends and improve overall customer satisfaction. By leveraging data-driven decision-making, ElecKart can work towards reversing the decline in revenue and enhancing its market position.
